# Change Log

## [1.2.0]
- [Changed] Upgrade to nativescript-2.3.0
- [Fixed] Bug in prevent-suspend where the plugin failed to re-start its prevent-suspend timer if no MotionActivity event occurred during that interval.  Prevent-suspend system should now operate completely independently of MotionDetector.
- [Fixed] `#stop` method wasn't calling `stopMonitoringSignificantChanges`, resulting in location-services icon failing to toggle OFF.
- [Fixed] Issue where iOS crashes when configured with null url.
- [Added] iOS `watchPosition` mechanism.
- [Changed] Refactored iOS motion-detection system.  Improved iOS motion-triggering when using `CMMotionActivityManager` (ie: when not using `disableMotionActivityUpdates: true`).  iOS can now trigger out of stationary-mode just like android, where it sees a 'moving-type' motion-activity (eg: 'on_foot', 'in_vehicle', etc).  Note: this will still occur only when your app isn't suspended (eg: app is in foreground, `preventSuspend: true`, or `#watchPosition` is engaged).
- [Changed] Refactored iOS "prevent suspend" system to be more robust.
- [Fixed] iOS locations sent to Javascript client had a different `uuid` than the one persisted to database (and synced to server).
-[Added] new iOS 10 .plist required key for accelerometer updates `NSMmotionUsageDescription` to `config.xml`.
- [Added] New required android permission `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.location.gps" />`.
- [Fixed] `removeGeofences` was removing stationary-region.  This would prevent stationary-exit if called while device is in stationary-mode
- [Fixed] Android pukes when it receives an empty schedule `[]`.
- [Fixed] Android when configured with `batchSync: true, autoSync: true` was failing because the plugin automatically tweaked `autoSync: false` but failed to reset it to the configured value.  This behaviour was obsolete and has been removed.
- [Added] Add new config `@param {Integer} autoSyncThreshold [0]`.  Allows you to specify a minimum number of persisted records to trigger an auto-sync action.
- [Fixed] Issue #837.  Android `SimpleDateFormat` used for rendering location timestamp was not being used in a thread-safe manner, resulting in corrupted timestamps for some
- [Fixed] Issue #804, null pointer exeception on mGoogleApiClient
- [Fixed] Issue #806.  PlayServices connect error event was fired before listeners arrive; Dialog to fix problem was never shown.
- [Changed] Removed `app-compat` from Gradle dependencies.
- [Changed] Fire http error callback when HTTP request is not 200ish (ie: 200, 201, 204).  Fixes issue #819.  Contradicts #774.
- [Changed] Remove `play-services:app-compat-v7` from Gradle dependencies
- [Fixed] Android heartbeat location wasn't having its meta-data updated (ie: `event: 'heartbeat', battery:<current-data>, uuid: <new uuid>`)
- [Changed] Reduce Android `minimumActivityRecognitionConfidence` default from `80` to `75` (issue #825)
- [Changed] Android will ask for location-permission when `#configure` is executed, rather than waiting for `#start`.
- [Changeed] Android will catch `java.lang.SecurityException` when attempting to request location-updates without "Location Permission"
